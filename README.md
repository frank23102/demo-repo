I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented Computer Engineering student with
proficiency in C++, Java, and Verilog, as well as a strong understanding of computer
hardware. Currently contributing to an interdisciplinary project focused on the
development of an electric bicycle attachment, spanning both hardware and software
aspects. I am passionate about enhancing coding skills and gaining in-depth
knowledge in hardware engineering. I am aspiring to transition into the artificial
intelligence industry to leverage my skill set in solving complex, real-world challenges.
